        * Developed graph embedding technique for node attribute prediction by employing in graphs with topoogical information independent of node contents by expanding state-of-the-art embeddings focusing to topology and feature information. 
        * Analyzed multiple graph information (node contents, topological inforation, topological embedding, node properties information indicating data flow through each node) impact on node attribute prediction for homogeneous graph datasets. 
        * Developed an algorithm to generate k-hopped topological and feature information for graph embeddings and analyzed their influence on six embedding techniques.
        * Automated gene properties (p-value) prediction from gene's ontopological inter-relations for certain disease (Alzheimer's) disregarding gene's other properties.
        * Automated analyzing technique for involvement of gene and genesets clustering for several diseases from GeneWeaver platform. 
        * Projects: [Topological graph embedding](https://github.com/tonnidas/AttributePrediction_FeatureVsTopology), [Graph information influence](https://github.com/tonnidas/AttributePredictionGraphTopology), [k-hop](https://github.com/tonnidas/LinkPrediction_Comparison_Hop), [k-hop_ARGA](https://github.com/tonnidas/LinkPrediction_ARGA_Hop), [P-value](https://github.com/tonnidas/Pvalue_Prediction)

        * Automated sign language similarity analysis with implementing a 3D multistage temporal convolutional network instead of traditional Lexicostatistics.
        * Developed a mapping study of machine learning model, fairness and feasibility of these AI models, methodologies to achieve them, challanges and prospective methods. 
        * Analyzed effect of quantum classifiers and classical classifiers convergence on different types of seperable and datasets.
