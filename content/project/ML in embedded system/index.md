Machine Learning en Sistemas Embebidos is a spanish course for Machine Learning in Embedded Systems. this course was initiated by Dr. Pablo Rivas, who is working for Baylor University. He is the main instructor in this course. Along with Dr. Rivas, Dr. Javier Orduz, Dr. Graciela Ramirez Alonso and Ernesto Quevedo Caballero also were involved in preparing course materials. I was responsible for backend maintenance.

I was involved in this project as a Research Assistant for Dr. Rivas in his Artificial Intelligence lab at Baylor University. This was one of the many projects that was involved in.
