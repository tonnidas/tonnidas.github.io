#### Why I have done it:
- I was interested in games and staff and so, I though lets try to build one myself.  

#### When I have done it: 
- I have done it while I was in my 3rd year of undergraduate program at BRAC University, Bangladesh.

#### With whom I have done it:
- I had another group mate to help me with it namely Md. Alium Basir. He was as passionate as me to play a game that we have created ourselves. 

#### Technical details: 
- We used Unity and C# programming language.

#### Description:
- It was a beginner level desktop based 3D Game with 3 levels along with a start and end page. A person can run this game directly using the `BOXRUN` file in windows based pc. Click that button on the website and download the file and run it. 
- Its player is a movable cube that the user/player could move only right or left. 
- The cube always moves forward with a constant speed in each level. As the level goes up, the speed of the cube goes up too. It means that in level one the speed is moderate without any acceleration. after passing the level one, player moves to level two and here, the speed is more than the level one. the speed is default.
- The cube runs through a road full of objects. Main goal of the player is to successfully reach the end of the path in each level by passing all the obstacles to go to next level. Once the player has completed all the three levels, he has finished this game. (However, the third levels speed was insanely high which made it hard to pass).
- The cube maintains the physics of law (while colliding and moving).
- User will play on the player cubes perspective.

#### How to run the game directly: 
- You can run the game directly by clicking the `BOXRUN` button. It will download a folder which you will need to extract and than inside the folder you will find BOXRUN.exe file. Clicking this file will take you to the game. Remember you need this whole folder to make it work without any other software support. And you can run this game only in windows version.
