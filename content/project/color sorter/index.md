#### When I have done it: 
- After I completed graduating from BRAC University, Bangladesh.

#### Technical details: 
- I used C programming language, Energia IDE, MSP430, motor sensor, color sensor.

#### Description:
- It is a device capable of sorting out items of different color in different places.
- It can be used for sorting different colored fruits in the industries.
- It has 3 ways for 3 different colors.
- Each colored object will fall in that colored way.
- Color sensor detects the color of the object.
- The motor moves the object according to the ordered angle from `MSP430`.
