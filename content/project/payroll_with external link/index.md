#### Why I have done it:
- I built this out of self interest. This was my first website building project.

#### When I have done it: 
- After I completed graduating from BRAC University, Bangladesh.

#### Technical details: 
- Visual studio, C#, CSS, HTML5 etc.

#### Description:
- There is a drop down bar, in which the names of all the employees should be in alphabetic order.
- By clicking any of the names from the drop down bar, all the details of that employee should be displayed.
- In click with the generate button there should be a printable page with all the facilities of the employees calculated.
