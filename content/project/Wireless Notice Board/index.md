#### Why I have done it:
- For my Digital System Design course in my undergraduate program at BRAC University, I came up with the idea of this project.  

#### When I have done it: 
- I have done it while I was in my 4rt year of undergraduate program at BRAC University, Bangladesh.

#### Technical details: 
- GSM module, Arduino mega, LED display, C language etc.

#### Description:
- It Can show msg that is sent from a mobile number which is coded in the machine and can receive msg while anyone presses the button.
- It is a wireless device that allows sending and receiving massages from/to a phone and display received massages on the display of the device. 
- It is used for updating students about informationâ€™s by faculty if the faculty is not at the office when the students come to visit him. 
- The student can press the button to send a notification to the faculty and when the faculty sees it in his phone he can reply the msg and the msg should be shown on the led screen.
