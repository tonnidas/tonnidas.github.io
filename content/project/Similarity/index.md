A common activity for big data is determining similarity between two objects of the same type. Baseball reference has a formula for computing the similarity of players, found [here](https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/similarity.shtml).

The aim of this project was to look for players that should be in the Hall of Fame, but they are not using [Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). We say a player should be in the Hall of Fame is at least 3 of the 5 most similar players are in the Hall of Fame. This is also using similarity as the distance function with the kNN problem.

#### Why I have done it:
- I built this project as an assignment for Cloud Computing course while studying at Baylor University. I enjoyed solving these problems with new technologies.

#### When I have done it: 
- While I was in my first semester (Spring 2021) at Baylor University.

#### Technical details: 
- I used pySpark (RDD, Python), Dask (Python, Dask Bag), MongoDB (file system, MongoDB Query Language (MQL)) separately to solve the problem using the public Lahman's Baseball dataset.
