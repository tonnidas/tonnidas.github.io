abstract: The process demonstrates a method of generating a 3D model using depth and color information of real-object using our proposed algorithm. The primary idea of the method is to manipulate extracting of RGB and depth data from the 2D colored picture of that object and abstracting them within arrays to plot in three-dimensional frames to generate the 3D colored model of the real-object. The proposed system comprises of 3 phases. The phases include acquisition of color and depth information of real objects, extraction, and abstraction of RGB and depth data, generating a 3D model using our proposed algorithm method. Whereas, our proposed algorithm focuses on creating several 1D arrays for depth as well as the color data meaning Red, Green, Blue pixel values separately. By mapping the depth values accordingly pixel-wise 3D black and white models can be created where the background is also included. By limiting the depth values according to the position of the object the background can also be removed to construct te focused object's 3D model. Furthermore, our algorithm maps the RGB arrays in the black and white models to add proper colors pixel-wise. As a result, the colorful RGB 3D model can be achieved. Lastly, we implement or approach on three different case scenarios to valuate the efficiency of the approach.
