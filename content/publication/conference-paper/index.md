abstract: The research explored the opportunities to save times while  conducting student attendance in universities and colleges.  The research also emphasizes on minimizing proxy  attendance among students. In order to maintain a  sophisticated attendance system we have designed and  developed methodology which has unique features that will  allow lecturers and teachers to spend more productive hours  with their students. This research mainly focuses on smart  attendance system which allows classroom authorities to save  valuable hours. To increase student‟s attendance by  eliminating proxy attendance also a vital focus area of this  very research. Using a mobile and web application  development platform ensures security and effectiveness to  collect students attendance data and manage storage for it  without single paperwork. Unique identity of students for  protecting valid student‟s attendance from being adulterated  by proxy or fake students is provided to both users end  (teachers end and students end). The availability of smart devices may make sure of utilizing campus network.
