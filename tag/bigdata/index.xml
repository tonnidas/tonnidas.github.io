Baseball reference has a formula for computing the similarity of players, found &lt;a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/similarity.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of this project was to look for players that should be in the Hall of Fame, but they are not using &lt;a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database&lt;/a>. We say a player should be in the Hall of Fame is at least 3 of the 5 most similar players are in the Hall of Fame. This is also using similarity as the distance function with the kNN problem.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I built this project as an assignment for Cloud Computing course while studying at Baylor University. I enjoyed solving these problems with new technologies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>While I was in my first semester (Spring 2021) at Baylor University.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I used pySpark (RDD, Python), Dask (Python, Dask Bag), MongoDB (file system, MongoDB Query Language (MQL)) separately to solve the problem using the public Lahman&amp;rsquo;s Baseball dataset.&lt;/li>
