Underdeveloped countries are now working toward developing a healthcare system to assist people in avoiding bankruptcy due to medical expenses. Individuals who have health insurance have the advantage of paying a lower amount for medical care than the bill, which helps them deal with unexpectedly high medical bills. Government or private entities offer health care packages. For several organizations, such as hospitals, an accurate estimation of health costs is important. It necessitates the prediction of insurance costs based on an analytical dataset of important individual variables such as age, average monthly medical costs, and so on. In this paper, we investigate the dataset from Brett Lantz&amp;rsquo;s book Machine Learning with R which was simulated using demographic statistics in the United States, and we compare the efficiency of various models in predicting insurance costs on this dataset. To predict the cost, we employed Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, Regression with Neural Network, and Random Forest Regression, and we faced overfitting issues by running several experiments with tuning the hyper-parameters of the best performing model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantum Classifiers</title><link>/project/quantum-classifier/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/project/quantum-classifier/</guid><description>&lt;p>In recent years, researchers are looking into data transformations in the quantum information space to see whether they may improve robustness and performance. The evolution of quantum mechanics occurred because it could explain specific scenarios in which conventional formulas failed. As a result, it began to expand in analytical research domains such as machine learning, and it is now capable of functioning correctly, and in some circumstances better than classical machine learning. Classification is one of the crucial areas in Machine Learning (ML), and quantum classification analysis has started to gain prominence. In this paper, we focus on implementing four classification algorithms such as Support Vector Classification with Quantum Kernel (SVCQK), Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC), Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), and Circuit Quantum Neural Network Classifier (CQNNC). We also provide analytical results of case studies with various generated classifiable and semi-classifiable datasets. This study is to determine whether quantum information theory may shorten learning time or improve convergence when compared to traditional approaches.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SL similarity</title><link>/project/sign-language/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/project/sign-language/</guid><description>&lt;p>Due to the lack of more variate, native and continuous datasets, sign languages are low-resources languages that can benefit from multilingualism in machine translation. In order to analyze the benefits of approaches like multilingualism, finding the similarity between sign languages can guide better matches and contributions between languages. However, calculating the similarity between sign languages again implies a laborious work to measure how close or distant signs are and their respective contexts. For that reason, we propose to support the similarity measurement between sign languages through a video-segmentation-based machine learning model that will quantify this match among signs of different countries&amp;rsquo; sign languages. Using a machine learning approach the similarity measurement process can run more smoothly, compared to a more manual approach. We use a pre-trained temporal segmentation model for British Sign Language (BSL). We test it on three datasets, an American Sign Language (ASL) dataset, an Indian Sign Language (ISL), and an Australian Sign Language (AUSLAN) dataset. We hypothesize that the percentage of segmented and recognized signs by this machine learning model can represent the percentage of overlap or similarity between British and the other three sign languages. In our ongoing work, we evaluate three metrics considering Swadesh&amp;rsquo;s and Woodward&amp;rsquo;s list and their synonyms. We found that our intermediate-strict metric coincides with a more classical analysis of the similarity between British and American Sign Language, as well as with the classical low measurement between Indian and British sign languages. On the other hand, our similarity measurement between British and Australian Sign language just holds for part of the Australian Sign Language and not the whole data sample.&lt;/p>
