This area now offers significant literature that is complex and hard to penetrate for newcomers to the domain. Thus, a mapping study of articles exploring fairness issues is a valuable tool to provide a general introduction to this field. Our paper presents a systematic approach for exploring existing literature by aligning their discoveries with predetermined inquiries and a comprehensive overview of diverse bias dimensions, encompassing training data bias, model bias, conflicting fairness concepts, and the absence of prediction transparency, as observed across several influential articles. To establish connections between fairness issues and various issue mitigation approaches, we propose a taxonomy of machine learning fairness issues and map the diverse range of approaches scholars developed to address issues. We briefly explain the responsible critical factors behind these issues in a graphical view with a discussion and also highlight the limitations of each approach analyzed in the reviewed articles. Our study leads to a discussion regarding the potential future direction in ML and AI fairness.","tags":null,"title":"Fairness issues, current approaches, and challenges in machine learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tonni Das Jui","Erich Baker","Mary Lauren Benton"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"529f4aa0181a9cb98690574d5056f580","permalink":"/publication/conference-paper_k_hop/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper_k_hop/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper offers an algorithm to generate k-hopped topological and feature information in graphs.

In order to analyze the benefits of approaches like multilingualism, finding the similarity between sign languages can guide better matches and contributions between languages. However, calculating the similarity between sign languages again implies a laborious work to measure how close or distant signs are and their respective contexts.

Using a machine learning approach the similarity measurement process can run more smoothly, compared to a more manual approach. We use a pre-trained temporal segmentation model for British Sign Language (BSL). We test it on three datasets, an American Sign Language (ASL) dataset, an Indian Sign Language (ISL), and an Australian Sign Language (AUSLAN) dataset. We hypothesize that the percentage of segmented and recognized signs by this machine learning model can represent the percentage of overlap or similarity between British and the other three sign languages. In our ongoing work, we evaluate three metrics considering Swadesh's and Woodward's list and their synonyms. We found that our intermediate-strict metric coincides with a more classical analysis of the similarity between British and American Sign Language, as well as with the classical low measurement between Indian and British sign languages.

They want to see how quantum computing affects the robustness and performance of machine learning methods. Quantum mechanics succeed in explaining some phenomena where classical formulas failed in the past.

The developing QML discipline has proven solutions to issues that are equivalent (or comparable) to those addressed by classical machine learning, including classification and prediction problems using quantum classifiers. As a result of these factors, quantum classifier analysis has become one of the most important topics in QML. This paper studies four quantum classifiers, Support Vector Classification with Quantum Kernel (SVCQK), Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC), Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), and Circuit Quantum Neural Network Classifier (CQNNC).

Underdeveloped countries are now working toward developing a healthcare system to assist people in avoiding bankruptcy due to medical expenses. Individuals who have health insurance have the advantage of paying a lower amount for medical care than the bill, which helps them deal with unexpectedly high medical bills. Government or private entities offer health care packages. For several organizations, such as hospitals, an accurate estimation of health costs is important. It necessitates the prediction of insurance costs based on an analytical dataset of important individual variables such as age, average monthly medical costs, and so on. In this paper, we investigate the dataset from Brett Lantz\u0026rsquo;s book Machine Learning with R which was simulated using demographic statistics in the United States, and we compare the efficiency of various models in predicting insurance costs on this dataset. To predict the cost, we employed Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, Regression with Neural Network, and Random Forest Regression, and we faced overfitting issues by running several experiments with tuning the hyper-parameters of the best performing model.\n","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"8890e1916ab5d875e94f70bef22ebcca","permalink":"/project/insurance-prediction/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/insurance-prediction/","section":"project","summary":"Predicting health insurance cost using supervised learning technique.","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Health Insurance prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Machine Learning en Sistemas Embebidos is a spanish course for Machine Learning in Embedded Systems. this course was initiated by Dr. Pablo Rivas, who is working for Baylor University.

The primary idea of the method is to manipulate extracting of RGB and depth data from the 2D colored picture of that object and abstracting them within arrays to plot in three-dimensional frames to generate the 3D colored model of the real-object. The proposed system comprises of 3 phases. The phases include acquisition of color and depth information of real objects, extraction, and abstraction of RGB and depth data, generating a 3D model using our proposed algorithm method. Whereas, our proposed algorithm focuses on creating several 1D arrays for depth as well as the color data meaning Red, Green, Blue pixel values separately. By mapping the depth values accordingly pixel-wise 3D black and white models can be created where the background is also included. By limiting the depth values according to the position of the object the background can also be removed to construct te focused object's 3D model. Furthermore, our algorithm maps the RGB arrays in the black and white models to add proper colors pixel-wise. As a result, the colorful RGB 3D model can be achieved. Lastly, we implement or approach on three different case scenarios to valuate the efficiency of the approach.","tags":null,"title":"3D Model Generation of Real-Objects Using 2D Information","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math.

Technical details: We used Unity and C# programming language. Description: It was a beginner level desktop based 3D Game with 3 levels along with a start and end page. A person can run this game directly using the BOXRUN file in windows based pc. Click that button on the website and download the file and run it. Its player is a movable cube that the user/player could move only right or left. The cube always moves forward with a constant speed in each level. As the level goes up, the speed of the cube goes up too. It means that in level one the speed is moderate without any acceleration. after passing the level one, player moves to level two and here, the speed is more than the level one. the speed is default. The cube runs through a road full of objects. Main goal of the player is to successfully reach the end of the path in each level by passing all the obstacles to go to next level. Once the player has completed all the three levels, he has finished this game. (However, the third levels speed was insanely high which made it hard to pass). The cube maintains the physics of law (while colliding and moving). User will play on the player cubes perspective. How to run the game directly: You can run the game directly by clicking the BOXRUN button. It will download a folder which you will need to extract and than inside the folder you will find BOXRUN.exe file. Clicking this file will take you to the game. Remember you need this whole folder to make it work without any other software support. And you can run this game only in windows version.
